# Transcranial-Magnetic-Stimulation

This was a preliminary project to develop a DIY transcranial magnetic stimulation device. This project was inspired by Ben Krasnow from Applied Science on Youtube:

The contraption was able to induce mild twitches in the body. This was a very risky project since it dealt with very high voltages (~1000VDC) stored in 3.3mF of capacitance (1.7kJ of energy). Any shorting of the capacitors can create blinding flashes of light. Touching both terminals of the capacitor can fatally electrocute the subject. Chronic magnetic stimulation can exceed the maximum permissible EM dose, thus can have deleterious consequences. Wrongful stimulation of the brain can lead to permanent damage. The coil discharge can create powerful EM fields that can easily fry electronics and jam radio communication. Iâ€™ve had lots of experience with high voltage electronics. Replicate such a project at your own risk! Medical grade TMS machines follow international medical standards to the dot.
